Software for Robotics Tutorials
=========================================

.. important::

   In 2025-26 these tutorials will be phased out.
   The contents will be updated to Jazzy and the entire content will be unified in the same page
   https://ros2-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This repo contains exercises and materials for EEEN60021 Software For Robotics which follow on the work by Dr Murilo M. Marinho (https://ros2-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


Previously, Dr. Murilo Marinho's tutorial material had formed the backbone of the course material, however, there is still much ROS wilderness to explore.

These tutorials are intended to provide the same feeling as those earlier tutorials.
