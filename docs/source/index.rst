Software for Robotics Tutorials
=========================================

.. important::

   This is the archival version of the tutorials used for the second half of Software for Robotics from 2023-2024 to 2024-2025. 
   It has been replaced fully by: https://ros2-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This repo contains exercises and materials for EEEN60021 Software For Robotics which follow on the work by Dr Murilo M. Marinho (https://ros2-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


Previously, Dr. Murilo Marinho's tutorial material had formed the backbone of the course material, however, there is still much ROS wilderness to explore.

These tutorials are intended to provide the same feeling as those earlier tutorials.
